## Course 1: Introduction

```
In this course, you will learn about how self-driving cars work, and you’ll take a crack at your very first
autonomous vehicle project - finding lane lines on the road! We’ll also introduce the Nanodegree program
and the services we provide over the course of the journey.
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES

```
LESSON ONE Welcome
```
```
Take your first steps towards becoming a Self-Driving Car
Engineer! In this lesson, we’ll introduce you to the program,
help you discover the services we provide, and show you
all the incredible projects you’ll build. Get ready for an
incredible 6-month journey!
```
```
LESSON TWO Workspaces
```
```
Many projects and some quizzes will be accessed via
Workspaces. These workspaces streamline environment
setup, simplify project submission, and can be enabled with
GPU support. All workspaces are Linux-based and can be
interfaced via a shell (BASH). Some workspace interfaces
are direct from the shell, others run a JUPYTER Notebook
server and interaction is mainly through the JUPYTER
notebook interface.
```

## Course 2: Computer Vision

```
You’ll use a combination of cameras, software, and machine learning to find lane lines on difficult roads
and to track vehicles. You’ll start with calibrating cameras and manipulating images, and end by applying
support vector machines and decision trees to extract information from video.
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES

```
LESSON ONE Computer Vision

##### Course Project

##### Advanced Lane Finding

```
In this project, you will be writing code to identify lane lines on
the road, first in an image, and later in a video stream (really just a
series of images). To complete this project, you will use the tools you
learned about in the lesson and build upon them.
```
```
In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the
lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
```

## Course 3: Deep Learning

```
Deep learning has become the most important frontier in both machine learning and autonomous vehicle
development. Experts from NVIDIA and Uber ATG will teach you to build deep neural networks and train
them with data from the real world and from the Udacity simulator. By the end of this course, you’ll be
able to train convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs, and to drive a vehicle in the simulator
the same way you drive it yourself!
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES

leveraging existing canonical networks.
```

## Course 4: Sensor Fusion

```
Tracking objects over time is a major challenge for understanding the environment surrounding a vehicle.
Sensor fusion engineers from Mercedes-Benz will show you how to program fundamental mathematical
tools called Kalman filters. These filters predict and determine with certainty the location of other vehicles
on the road. You’ll even learn to do this with difficult-to-follow objects, by using an advanced technique: the
extended Kalman filter.
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES

```
LESSON ONE Sensors
```
```
Meet the team at Mercedes who will help you track objects
in real-time with Sensor Fusion.
```
```
LESSON TWO Kalman Filters
```
```
Learn from the best! Sebastian Thrun will walk you through
the usage and concepts of a Kalman Filter using Python.
```
```
LESSON THREE C++ Checkpoint Are you ready to build Kalman Filters with C++? Take these
quizzes to find out.
```
###### LESSON FOUR

```
Extended Kalman
Filters
```
```
In this lesson, you’ll build a Kalman Filter in C++ that’s
capable of handling data from multiple sources. Why C++?
Its performance enables the application of object tracking
with a Kalman Filter in real-time.
```
##### Course Project

##### Extended Kalman Filte

```
In this project, you’ll apply everything you’ve learned so far about
Sensor Fusion by implementing an Extended Kalman Filter in C++!
```

## Course 5: Localization

```
Localization is how we determine where our vehicle is in the world. GPS is great, but it’s only accurate to
within a few meters. We need single-digit centimeter-level accuracy! To achieve this, Mercedes-Benz engineers
will demonstrate the principles of Markov localization to program a particle filter, which uses data and a map to
determine the precise location of a vehicle.
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES

```
LESSON ONE Introduction to
Localization
```
```

a Particle Filter
```
```
Now that you understand how a particle filter works, you’ll
learn how to code a particle filter.
```

## Course 6: Path Planning

```
Path planning routes a vehicle from one point to another, and it handles how to react when emergencies
arise. The Mercedes-Benz Vehicle Intelligence team will take you through the three stages of path planning.
First, you’ll apply model-driven and data-driven approaches to predict how other vehicles on the road will
behave. Then you’ll construct a finite state machine to decide which of several maneuvers your own vehicle
should undertake. Finally, you’ll generate a safe and comfortable trajectory to execute that maneuver.
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES

```
LESSON ONE Search
```
```
In this lesson you will learn about discrete path planning
and algorithms for solving the path planning problem.
```
```
LESSON TWO Prediction
```
```
In this lesson you’ll learn how to use data from sensor
fusion to generate predictions about the likely behavior of
moving objects.
```
###### LESSON THREE

```
Behavior
Planning
```
```
In this lesson you’ll learn how to think about high level
behavior planning in a self-driving car.
```
```
LESSON FOUR Trajectory Generation
```
```

library to build candidate trajectories for the vehicle to
follow.
```
##### Course Project

##### Highway Driving

```

move the car through the world. Uber ATG will walk you through building both proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controllers and model predictive controllers. Between these control algorithms, you’ll become familiar with
both basic and advanced techniques for actuating a vehicle.
```
###### LEARNING OUTCOMES
